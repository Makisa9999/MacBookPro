      On this website I will talk about a lot of cars. Mostly what I am going to write aboutis going to be cars properties and their history. In 1769 the first steam powered car was on the market and only prestige people could afford that car. It was made by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. In 1808 Francois Isaac de Rivaz designed first car powered by an internal combustion engine fueld by hydrogen. Sixty-two years later Siegfriend Marcus built the first gasoline powered combustion engine which he placed on a pushcart. Marcus created two-cycled combustion engine. In 1880 the new four-cycle engine was introduced. Later, in 1913 the Ford Model T, that was created by Ford Motor Company. This was the first car that was produced in a mass number on a moving assembley line. By 1927 Ford Motor Company had produced over 15,000,000 Model T automobiles.
